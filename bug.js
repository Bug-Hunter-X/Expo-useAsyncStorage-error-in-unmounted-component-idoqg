This error occurs when using the Expo `useAsyncStorage` hook within a component that is not mounted.  The `useAsyncStorage` hook attempts to access and modify the AsyncStorage, but since the component is unmounted, it can cause a crash or unexpected behavior. This is because the component's state and lifecycle methods are no longer accessible after unmounting.
